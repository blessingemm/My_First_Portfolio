    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a Physics graduate from Kogi State, Nigeria, with a strong passion for technology. My journey into tech began during my SIWES (Student Industrial Work Experience Scheme) in a tech company in my third year at university. Since then, I have embraced every opportunity to learn, grow, and deepen my skills in the field.</p>
    <p>Driven by curiosity and determination, I completed the ALX Artificial Intelligence Career Essentials and Professional Foundation programs, and I am currently advancing my knowledge through the ALX Software Engineering course. My goal is to make a significant global impact by building innovative solutions that solve real-world problems through technology.</p>
